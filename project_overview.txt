# Project Overview: Fruit Recognition Classifier

## Introduction
This project aims to create software that can identify different fruits independently, and is able to correctly distinguish between them. 
The primary goal is to take a step forward into machine learning and gain a basic understanding in how to utilise it.

### Objectives
- Data Collection: Acquire a diverse dataset of fruit images representing a broad range of fruit types.
- Model Development: Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for fruit image classification.
- Model Training: Train the CNN model using the collected dataset to achieve a baseline level of accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface to interact with the fruit classifier, enabling users to submit images for classification.
- Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation, including a README file with instructions on how to use the fruit classifier and any prerequisites.

## Motivation
The idea for the project was one of a few I'd considered carrying out as a means to venture into the realm of machine learning.
I feel like it is an achievable starting point, with a straight-forward path to completion.

## Scope
This project will:

- Focus on classifying common fruit types.
- Develop an image classification model.
- Aim for a moderate level of accuracy suitable for beginners.
- Use a moderately-sized dataset.
- Include testing with real-world images.
- Not include extensive user interface development.
- Allow for future expansion as skills and resources grow.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we expect to:

- Have a functional fruit image classifier.
- Achieve a reasonable level of accuracy in fruit classification.
- Gain practical experience in image classification techniques.
- Provide clear documentation for using the fruit classifier.
- Lay the foundation for potential future improvements and applications.

### Audience
This project is primarily intended for personal skill development and learning. 
While there is no specific external audience, it serves as a valuable resource for self-education and gaining practical experience in machine learning and image classification.

## Timeline
- Start Date: October 25, 2023
- Expected Completion: N/A

The timeline for this project is intentionally left flexible. 
Since this project is primarily for personal skill development, the completion date may vary based on progress and time allocation. 
The focus is on quality learning and achievement rather than adhering to strict deadlines, especially given that this is my first step into machine learning.

## Version Control
I'll use Git to keep track of changes in my project. The project will be hosted on GitHub for easy access.

**Note**: This project is purely for fun and serves no real-world purpose.
